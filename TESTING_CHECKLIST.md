- [ ] Click "Regenerate DXF"
- [ ] New DXF generated with changes
- [ ] Download and verify changes

### 8. Error Handling Test
**Prompt:** "Design a simple rectangle"
Then edit code to introduce error (e.g., remove `doc =` line)

- [ ] Click "Regenerate DXF"
- [ ] Error appears in right panel
- [ ] Error message is clear
- [ ] Status shows "Failed to generate DXF"
- [ ] Can fix and retry

### 9. Conversation Flow Test
**Prompt:** "Design a cantilever beam 3 meters long"

- [ ] First response with analysis
- [ ] Follow up: "Add a point load of 5kN at the free end"
- [ ] Claude updates design
- [ ] New code generated
- [ ] DXF updated

### 10. Performance Test
- [ ] First request (cold): completes in < 30 seconds
- [ ] Second request (warm): completes in < 20 seconds
- [ ] No memory leaks (check browser memory)
- [ ] Multiple requests work without refresh

## Backend Testing (With Lambda)

### 1. Deploy Backend
```bash
cd backend
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Deployment succeeds
- [ ] API endpoint is output
- [ ] Copy endpoint URL

### 2. Update Frontend
```bash
# Edit frontend/.env.local
# Set LAMBDA_API_ENDPOINT=https://xxxxx.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Prod
```

- [ ] Environment file updated
- [ ] Restart dev server

### 3. Lambda Execution Test
**Prompt:** "Design a simple beam"

- [ ] Request goes to Lambda (check logs)
- [ ] Execution is faster than local mode
- [ ] DXF generated successfully
- [ ] Check Lambda logs: `sam logs -n DxfExecutorFunction --tail`

### 4. Error Recovery Test
**Prompt:** Create a design that might have errors

- [ ] First attempt fails
- [ ] Execution log shows "Attempt 1/3"
- [ ] Claude fixes code automatically
- [ ] Execution log shows "Asking Claude to fix..."
- [ ] Second attempt succeeds
- [ ] Execution log shows success

### 5. Lambda Monitoring
```bash
sam logs -n DxfExecutorFunction --tail
```

- [ ] Logs show function invocations
- [ ] No unhandled errors
- [ ] Execution times reasonable (< 5s warm)

### 6. Cold Start Test
- [ ] Wait 5 minutes (Lambda goes cold)
- [ ] Make request
- [ ] First request slower (2-5s)
- [ ] Second request faster (< 2s)

## Production Testing (Vercel)

- [ ] Special characters handled
- [ ] Code generates correctly
- [ ] No encoding errors

### 4. Rapid Requests
